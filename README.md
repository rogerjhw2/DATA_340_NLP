#The visualization I chose was a pie chart showing the top 15 most frequently mentioned organizations in the video descriptions of Andrew Huberman's video library. I believe such a visualization is important since it could indicate a certain propensity to mention or use research from only a select few universities or organizations. According to the data, Stanford University appears to be the most referenced organization.
